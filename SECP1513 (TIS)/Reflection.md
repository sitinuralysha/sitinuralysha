| **Industry Visit: UTM Digital Open Day** | <br> The talk gave us a great overview of how **UTM Digital** makes life on campus easier. They provide essential services like **UTMid**, graduate emails, **UTMSmart**, WiFi, and licensed software, where it helps students and staff stay connected and make daily tasks more efficient. I was surprised by how much these digital services impact our daily experience. From accessing emails and using WiFi to getting the software we need, everything runs smoothly thanks to these resources. Overall, the talk made me realize just how important **UTM Digital** is for making university life in **UTM** more efficient. Without these digital services, things wouldn’t be easy. <br> <hr> **Suggestions for Improvement**: <br> <br> I think the session could have been a bit longer. It would have been nice to have more time to visit booths from companies like **Copilot**, **Canon**, and others. I would have loved to learn more about their products, services, and the tech they were showcasing. Having more time would also have allowed me to attend other talks and I feel like I missed out some valuable information. I hope I could explore more to make the experience even better. <br> <br> |
| **PC Assembly (Lab)**                    | <br> In the lab, we got to learn about the parts of a computer, like the hard disk, RAM, motherboard and other components. The staff showed us how each part works and then had us take everything out and put it back together in the right order. It was a hands-on experience that helped me understand how all the parts fit together and work as a whole. Doing this lab gave me a lot of knowledge in handling computer hardware and made me realize the importance of each component in the PC. <br> <hr> **Suggestions for Improvement**: <br> <br> I think it would’ve been helpful if we had more time to explore the components on our own after the demonstration. While the step-by-step process was great, I would’ve liked to have more time to really get hands-on with the parts and maybe troubleshoot a few issues on my own. Also, it might be useful to have a bit more guidance on how to fix common problems that could happen when assembling a PC. <br> <br> |
| **Industrial Talk: PPG Career Talk**     | <br> The career talk showed us how important **ICT** is today. We learned that at **PPG**, ICT helps with efficiency, decision-making, and innovation. ICT helps PPG manage data, automate tasks, and improve communication. It also helps with things like quality control and staying competitive. We learned about different teams in PPG, like **RPA CoE** and **Oracle CoE ERP**, that support these efforts. The talk made us see how much ICT impacts industries and inspired us to keep improving our digital skills for future career opportunities. <br> <hr> **Suggestions for Improvement**: <br><br> It would have been helpful to have time for asking questions and to dive deeper into how ICT is used at PPG. I think more real-life examples could have made the talk even more interesting. Also, having the chance to hear from some of the ICT team members about their roles and career paths would have been really valuable. <br> <br> |
